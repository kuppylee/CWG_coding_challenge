This is a weather app built using swift programming language

To run this app : Run Pod install 
Things to improve on : 
1) I could still persist the Forecasted weather data to cater for when there is no network connection
2) I could Integrate maps to see information about current location but google places API requires an API keys which needs to be paid for 
3) The favourite view could be well designed also
